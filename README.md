## Build

In order to build storybook and the component library, navigate to the web directory

```
cd web
```

First, you need to install the dependencies by executing `yarn`

After that, just run `yarn build` to build storybook and the component library.

A new directory called `storybook-static` is generated in the current directory which should be deployed.
