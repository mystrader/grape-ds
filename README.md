## Build

In order to build storybook and the component library be sure to install Node.JS & yarn.

First, you need to install the dependencies by executing

```
yarn
```

After that, just run `yarn build` to build storybook and the component library.

A new directory called `build` is generated in the current directory which should be deployed.

It includes two folders that should be available under following URLs

```
build/storybook -> aurora.ubergrape.com/storybook
build/docs -> aurora.ubergrape.com
```
