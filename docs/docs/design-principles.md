## Approachable
### Biased towards simplicity
Keep it simple rather than flexible. Make complex things possible. We don't overload the experience. We don't offer 10 options, there are as little decisions to make, to get a perfect outcome. We choose sensible defaults and narrow down to options meaningful for most of our users. We value quality over quantity.
### Clear
We create a clean, well-lit space where people's communication can sparkle. We are clear in what we communicate to increase confidence. We build our products based on the way humans think (natural mental models) to support intuitive understanding without any direct explanation. Every element must have purpose, and contribute to the purpose of a larger element it is part of. All things have an impact. If you can't explain what an element is for, most likely it shouldn't be there.
## Respectful
### Universal
People with different backgrounds, abilities, devices and technological capabilities, speaking a multitude of languages, and being in various environments are collaborating using our product. This is why we design and build our products to be welcoming and accessible, and exclude as few people as possible.
### Mindful
The attention and privacy of our users are precious. We stay in the background when needed, and surprise in the right moment to make an interaction more memorable. If something moves in focus, everything else "ducks" away. We avoid dissonance, like unnecessary notifications or unhelpful system messages, and only distract users with changes that are personally relevant.
## Human
### Facilitating
We foster emotionally satisfying interpersonal communication. The interface is seamless and hidden, you only notice it when you interact with it. Like any good facilitator, our voices and visual style stay in the background, behind people's faces, voices, and people's expressions. We provide solutions that enable people to achieve their goal without noticing the heavy lifting in the background that supports them.
### Delightful
Itâ€™s not human when things are overly technical or functional. The experience is delightful, but not overwhelming. We give elements the space to breathe, and bring delight with details. Anything a user directly touches must spark like creative ideas we have. Animations are short (like a thought) but colorful, reactions (by the interface) are more subtle and simple.
